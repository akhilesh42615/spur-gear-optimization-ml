# Spur Gear Optimization using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based regression project to optimize spur gear design parameters using synthetic datasets generated from mechanical formulas.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project explores the application of supervised ML techniques â€” specifically the Random Forest Regressor â€” to predict optimized spur gear parameters like:
- Number of teeth
- Pitch diameter
- Face width
- Hardness (BHN)
- Weight

The dataset was generated using engineering design equations, and two models were trained:
- **Known Diameter Model** â€“ When pitch diameter is known
- **Unknown Diameter Model** â€“ When number of teeth is known
